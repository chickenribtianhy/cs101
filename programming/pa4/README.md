4003 is a NPC problem that is similar to traveling salesman.

I have tried simulated annealing, as well as ant_colony, but both didn't perform well in online autograding. It may have problems with parameter setting, whether it could fit the test case well or not, or there may be faults in both algorithm. Greedy performs steadily, but not good.
